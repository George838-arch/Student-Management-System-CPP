## Overview
A menu-driven console-based Student Management System developed using C++.
The project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and core Data Structures implemented from scratch.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures:
  - Singly Linked List
  - Stack (LIFO)
  - Queue (FIFO)

## Features
- Add, display, search, and delete student records
- Dynamic student storage using linked lists
- Track recently deleted students using stack
- Simulate student service handling using queue
- Menu-driven console interface

## Data Structures Usage
- Linked List: Store and manage student records dynamically
- Stack: Store last deleted student (LIFO behavior)
- Queue: Handle student service requests (FIFO behavior)

## Object-Oriented Design
- Encapsulation of student data
- Modular class-based system design
- Clear separation of responsibilities

## Memory Management
- Dynamic memory allocation using new and delete
- Safe pointer handling
- Proper cleanup of allocated memory

## How to Run
Compile:
g++ main.cpp -o student_system

Run:
./student_system

## Sample Menu
1. Add Student
2. Display Students
3. Delete Student
4. Search Student
5. Show Last Deleted Student
6. Serve Student
7. Exit

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical implementation of linked lists, stacks, and queues
- Strong understanding of pointers and memory management
- Experience building real systems using basic data structures
